=============

An Online Genetic Algorithm for Maximising Object-Tracking Utility in Market-Based Networks of Distributed Smart Cameras.

This project forms the software portion of the research project I am completing for my degree. To find out more about me, visit http://hxcaine.com

This code is an extension of the 'Smart Camera Simulation Environment' by Lukas Esterle and Marcin Bogdanski, which can be found at http://github.com/EPiCS/CamSim

Structure
---------

Please note that I am using the project in a different structure than the project I have forked from. I am using the 'src' directory in the root instead of src directories within each of the directories (e.g. previously /ai/src/... is now /src/ai...) which is more in keeping with Java package structures. The build script exclusively reads this directory.
